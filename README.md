# Buttplug.io proof-of-concept mod for Ultrakill

So [Shammy](https://twitter.com/shammytv) made a tweet about wanting a Buttplug mod for Ultrakill.

And I made one in a couple of hours, just 'cause I hadn't done a game mod in a while and wanted to see how fast it came together.

## But where's the code?

I'm getting it together now, but I posted the URL for the repo before I got the repo actually *sorted* so uh, oops. Gimme like 20 minutes.
