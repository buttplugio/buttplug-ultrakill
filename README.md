# Buttplug.io proof-of-concept mod for Ultrakill

So [Shammy](https://twitter.com/shammytv) made a tweet about wanting a Buttplug mod for Ultrakill.

And I made one in a couple of hours, just 'cause I hadn't done a game mod in a while and wanted to see how fast it came together.

## Wait what

Ok so here's the deal. This mod is a **PROOF OF CONCEPT** to show how one would mod Ultrakill for Buttplug. It's not a *good* mod, mostly because I am extremely unfamiliar with the game, but it is a *working* mod, and that's what matters because I strive for honesty in my shitposts.

This mod uses:

- [Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) for toy control.
- [ManagedButtplugio]() for 

## Ok I wanna use it

You'll need

- [Intiface Central](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-central/releases) - This is basically the
  "hardware hub" program for Buttplug. It's free (and soon to be open source, just finishing up some
  licensing stuff)! It currently works on Windows and Mac, Linux coming soon, Android/iOS apps in
  app store review now!
- A compatible vibrator (we support like, 200+ in Buttplug.io, see IOSTIndex for a list)
- This mod (see the Releases directory)

To install:

- Download zip
- Unzip in your [ULTRAKILL Install Dir]/BepInEx/Plugins directory

To run:
- Start Intiface Central
- Start Intiface Central Server (hit the big play button in Intiface Central)
- THOSE TWO STEPS MUST HAPPEN FIRST, THE MOD IS EXTREMELY DUMB AND WILL NOT RETRY
- Start Ultrakill

You should see "UK.Buttplug Connect" appear in the control panel of Intiface Central.

## But where's the code?

I'm getting it together now, but I posted the URL for the repo before I got the repo actually *sorted* so uh, oops. Gimme like 20 minutes.
